        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> In this final lab we are presented with three sets of codes, which are as follows: Chaos Game, L-systems, and Hilbert curves. Before I discuss the goals I have for this lab, I would like to define what each of the three terms that were previously listed are. The Chaos Game is a set of code that uses randomness and iterations to produce fractals. In this particular case, the code was used to produce a Sierpenski triangle, which we have done in a previous lab. Aside from this, we can use the Chaos Game to produce: Sierpinski carpets, Dragon curves, hexagon-shaped fractals, or Barnsley ferns. The L-systems, also known as the Lindenmayer systems, are used to create complex shapes and patterns (fractals or plants) using formal grammar. It is often used to make  This "formal grammar" which will be discussed in more depth in other sections of this report. L-systems can be used in video games, to produce plants/trees, cell division, roads, Koch snowflakes, Dragon curves, and Peano curves. A Hilbert curve is a type of L-system, where a pattern is created in the form of a square on a two-dimensional plane.</p>
