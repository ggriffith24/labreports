        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> In this final lab we are presented with three sets of codes, which are as follows: Chaos Game, L-systems, and Hilbert curves. Before I discuss the goals I have for this lab, I would like to define what each of the three terms that were previously listed are. The Chaos Game is a set of code that uses randomness and iterations to produce fractals. In this case, the code was used to produce a Sierpenski triangle, which we did in a previous lab. Aside from this, we can use the Chaos Game to produce: Sierpinski carpets, Dragon curves, hexagon-shaped fractals, or Barnsley ferns. The L-systems, also known as the Lindenmayer systems, are used to create complex shapes and patterns (fractals or plants) using formal grammar. It is often used to make  This "formal grammar" which will be discussed in more depth in other sections of this report. L-systems can be used in video games, to produce plants/trees, cell division, roads, Koch snowflakes, Dragon curves, and Peano curves. A Hilbert curve is a type of L-system, where a pattern is created in the form of a square on a two-dimensional plane. As a result of this lab, I would like to use each of the code types to produce a different variation of the base code as well as use it to present other types of fractals or structures. For example, I will use the Chaos Game to produce an altered version of the Sierpinski triangle but also attempt to create a Dragon Curve (or any other example that I listed). I am not familiar with a Peano so I hope to produce that with the L-system. Lastly, I would like to make a more complex version of the Hilbert curve.</p>

        <p>Below I will present all of the original code of each of the code types that I have discussed above. Along with the code, I'll explain each function of the code and display an image of what is produced as a result of this code. The first set of code presented is the Chaos Game representation of the Sierpinski Triangle.</p>

      <p>In the code above we notice that there are a few new lines of code that we have not encountered yet. randint is a code that imports the use of random integers in the line of code. The midpoint(P, Q) is defined specifically to find the midpoint between both the x and y coordinates. More specifically 0.5*(P[0] + Q[0]) determine the midpoint of the x coordinates. 0.5*(P[1] + Q[1]) calculated the midpoint of the y-coordinate. The "vertices=" and what follows, explicitly identifies the vertices of the triangles. 
      
      Next in the line of code, we use iteration. First, we define how many times we are iterating, which in 
 this case is 50,0000 times. I noticed that when the number decreases then the figure is less defined. At first, I was a bit confused about what x, y = [0]*iterates, [0]*iterates and x[0], y[0] = random(), random() meant. After a bit of research, I noticed that the first set of code essentially is a placeholder for the number of coordinates based on the number of iterations. The second line of code x[0], y[0] = random(), random(), assigns a random number for the starting x and y value.
        
      for i in range(1, iterates):
    k = randint(0, 2)
    x[i], y[i] = midpoint(vertices[k], (x[i-1], y[i-1]))
        
This code above determines where the next plot will be depending on the vertices defined above. k is defined by choosing a random vertice as they are specified in previous lines of the code. randin(0,2) chooses a random number ranging from 0 to 2 (which is the number of the vertices we have). We need this line of code to determine where the next point is plotted depending on the vertices location, and the midpoint of an x- y-coordinate (specifically halfway to the randomly selected vertex). 
        The remainder of the code is similar to what we have previously seen. We can determine the figure size, title and size of the axis. plt.scatter(x,y, color='b',s=0.1) determines the color of the dots in the scatter plot as well as its size.

 <p>To produce a Barnsley Fern, we are first defining four transformative functions. These functions are defined by the "def f#(x,y):" code where the # is replaced with the number of the function. Probabilities for each of the functions are then defined by: probabilities = [0.01, 0.85, 0.07, 0.07]. Next, based on the probabilities we define when we will use each of the functions. For example, if a random number is generated (by the rand= random.random() code) that is less than 0.85, then the point that is created uses the second function that is presented. As we have seen before we define the number of iterations by placing a value after "iterations=". To ensure that the fern is plotted correctly the code zip(*fern_points) groups the values of x and all the values of y together instead of viewing them as a coordinate together. </p>

<p> The first line of code is what we previously have seen, introducing the turtle to the image. All the lines proceeding this sets up and execute the L-system codes. The def apply_rule(char,rules) and return rules.get(char,char) codes apply given rules to certain characters. If there is a particular character that does not have a rule then the character is left alone. After we are going to define the actions done by the turtle to produce the L-system. F means to move forward, + changes the angle by moving to the left, and - changes the angle by moving to the right. The next two lines for me were a bit confusing when I initially read it. Essentially, for the '[' command we are first determining where the x and y are, then the angle that we are currently at, and then saving that position for another time. As for the ']' command is going back to the position that was previously saved and creates a new branch from a different point ( a different coordinate). Now we explicitly define the rule for F, and the number of iterations, so that when the command is called it can be done correctly. Then we set up the turtle, as we have done in previous labs, identifying the starting position angle and pen color. The final set of codes for the L-system is determining the length of the branches and the angle. </p>

<p> Some of the lines in this code are similar to the ones we previously discussed in the L-system section because we will be using the L-system to create the Hilbert Curve. The first line of code that we will discuss is

Again as before we are applying rules to a character it has and on top of that it is creating a list of strings and connecting them into a new string. Next, we define the commands, as before, and then we define what L and R are. Then we have to create a string for the Hilbert Curve and specify the size of the curve. The remaining lines of code determine the number of iterations, the angle, the turtles' starting position, the turtles' angle, and the color of the pen.</p>

        <p> Based on the information given above these are the following goals that I would like to complete by the end of this lab: produce a Dragon Curve using the Chaos Game, a Peano Curve using the L-system, and an altered version of the Hilbert Curve.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to produce a Dragon Curve from the base code given for the Chaos game. In turn, I decided to change the vertices and include multiple colors and different iteration amounts. This is shown in the image and line of code below. The colors.apprend() code is what is specifically used to integrate the different colors into the final product. </p>

  <p> Next, I attempted to create a Barnsley Fern with an additional branch that protrudes from about the middle of the main stem. To do this, we would have to create an additional function that would produce the additional branch. Unfortunately, I did not get this result after adding the additional branch (formula) and changing the formula values. Below I have an example of another structure that was created because of the additional function and different values of the function. (the code is also shown)</p>

<p> L-systems are the next type of code that is going to be manipulated. Previously, I stated that I would like to create a Peano Curve. From research, most of the Peano curves I have seen look similar to the Hilbert Curve. Both of the code is restricted to a certain area, in this case, a square. Below I have presented a code for the Peano curve. The code will be explained further after the line of code.
  Apart from the Peano Curve, I attempted to make a tree using the leaf that was given as a the base code. Alas, after many trials I was not able to produce a tree that I envisionsed. After the image and code for the Peano curve I have displayed an altered version of the base leaf that was provided. When I changed the rules for F, I was able to produce a branch like stucture.

<p> The similarity that I noticed in this line of code is the use of the rules. The same rules of F,+, and -, still apply and produce the same result. The difference in this line of code is that we use the placeholders of L and R. These do not have an action that they produce but assist with the iteration to produce each segment of the curve. rad = math.radians(direction) and the few proceeding lines of code are responsible for the angle at which the forward movement is performed. In this case, the angle is calculated using the cosine function.</p>

<p> The Hilbert Curve is the last image we will discuss. Originally, I aimed to make a more complex version of the original and an animation to go along with it. I have made multiple attempts to create an animation of the altered code but I was only able to get an animation of a vertical line. One of the images that I was able to produce is a Hilbert curve with smaller lines, making it look a bit more complex. Another image that I was able to produce is a Hilbert curve with three alternating colors. I have provided the code as well as two images (to show a closer view of the curve). </p>

<p> In order to implement the alternating colors this code is added:
   <section id="code">
  <pre><code class= "language-python">
  colors = ['skyblue', 'orange', 'red'] #Alternating colors
  color_index = 0
     </code></pre>
        </section>
The color_index code being set to 0 signifies that it begins at the first color. Next, we need to add: 
   <section id="code">
  <pre><code class= "language-python">
  color(colors[color_index])
          color_index = (color_index + 1) % len(colors)
     </code></pre>
        </section>
   
to alternate the color (from my understanding each time we create a new line/move forward). Since we are adding these lines of code we need to remove the color('blue') that was in the original code, since this would contradict each other.</p>

     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p> In this lab we looked at various types of code used to produce varying images/fractals. More specifically we looked at the Hilbert Curve (which is a type of L-system), the L-system, the Chaos game, and the Barnsley Fern. We discussed the role each code line plays in producing the final image. With this knowledge, I then produced fractals with different variations of the original code. I sought to create a Dragon Curve using the Chaos system, but I was unsuccessful. It was fascinating to see the development of the images in the Chaos Game. As the iteration was decreased fewer points were produced. Since this type of code uses randomness the points are sporadic and there may be more areas filled than the other. One of the results that was shown above is a Sierpinski Triangle with three different colors, depending on the area where the points were placed. Next, I utilized the code provided for the Barnsely Fern to create a slightly altered version of the fern with a wider set of leaves. L-systems was the next set of code that we discussed. Again, with this type of code, my objective was to create a Peano Curve. I successfully was able to produce this code as well as alter the code for the leaf to create a branch. The final set of code that was experimented with was the Hilbert curve. I noticed that this and the Peano Curve were quite similar. Each of these curves used rules to signify forward movement and the changing of angles. In addition, these curves are confined to a certain area, that being a square. With the Hilbert Curve, I was able to increase the number of iterations that were conducted and create an image with altering colors.  In closing, after much experimentation and research,h I was able to create more complex fascinating images of three types of code.</p>
