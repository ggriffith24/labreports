        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This lab is titled Infinite Dust. Initially, when analyzing the base code for the lab, I realized we are utilizing a Cartesian plane to create black bars/lines. We first start with a long rectangular bar then as we move lower the quantity of the bars increases. But the size of these bars also become progressively smaller. In this lab I would like to manipulate the color of the bars as well as create a downwards triangle.
        
        Below I have shown an image of the base code that was given in this lab (which describes what was said above). </p>

        <h2>Results and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Before showing the production of my extended code, I will show the code and describe what individual lines of the code do.</p>
<section id="code">
  <pre><code class= "language-python">
    # Import libraries for math and plotting
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set initial parameters
x_start = 0       # Starting x-coordinate of the first bar
x_end = 3         # Ending x-coordinate of the first bar
y_position = 0    # Starting y-coordinate (height of the first bar)
bar_height = 5    # Height of each bar
spacing = 10      # Space between bars (distance downwards)
depth = 6         # Number of levels to draw

# Define a function to create the Cantor Set pattern
def cantor_set(x_start, x_end, y_position, depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return []

    # Left and right segments for the current bar
    left_segment = [[x_start, x_start + (x_end - x_start) / 3, y_position]]
    right_segment = [[x_end - (x_end - x_start) / 3, x_end, y_position]]

    # Recursively generate segments for the next levels
    left_recursive = cantor_set(x_start, x_start + (x_end - x_start) / 3, y_position - spacing, depth - 1)
    right_recursive = cantor_set(x_end - (x_end - x_start) / 3, x_end, y_position - spacing, depth - 1)

    # Combine the current segments with the results from recursive calls
    return left_segment + right_segment + left_recursive + right_recursive

# Generate Cantor Set segments data
segments = np.array(cantor_set(x_start, x_end, y_position, depth))  # Convert to an array for easy plotting

# Plot the Cantor Set
plt.figure(figsize=(25, 25))

# Draw each segment as a black bar
for x_start, x_end, y in segments:
    plt.fill_between([x_start, x_end], [y] * 2, [y - bar_height] * 2, color="black")

# Hide the axes for a clean look
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
     </code></pre>

<p>The x_start code determines the starting point on the x axis for the  bars. Similarly, the y_posotion, is the same as x_start but of course for the y axis. The x_end identifies the end point in which the bar stops, this also determines the length of the bar. bar_height determines the height of the bar with respect to the y-axis. Initially when I looked at the spacing command I thought that this meant that the spacing would be the equivalent to the quantity set. In other words if the spacing=3 then there would be a three unit space (with respect to the y axis) that would be in between each bar segment. I realized that when I changed the spacing to 5 the first set of bars would end at the y value of 5, but thats also where the next set would start. When I changed the value to 6, i noticed that there was a one unit gap between each step. Depth determines how many sets of bars are being created. I then altered the left_segment and right_segment codes to see that it alters the length of each bar in the given depth level. </p>

 <section id="Conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> In this lab we used a plane to display a group of bars of varying lengths and heights. I wanted to create a triangle, whos apex pointed downward as an extension of the code but I was unsuccessful. However, I was able to extend the code to make bars of alternating colors.</p>
